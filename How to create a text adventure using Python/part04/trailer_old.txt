You wake. Your head is throbbing. Staggering to your feet, fear fills you.
You look around. You're on a path near an arch in an old brick wall.
'What the ... what? Where the heck am I?'
You don't remember where you are, who you are or how you got here.
You franticly search your pockets and find a torn slip of paper.
The paper is thick and smells vaguely of lilac.
The fragment of paper in your hand bears a coat of arms.
Perhaps you can heal yourself and get more information in the town.
