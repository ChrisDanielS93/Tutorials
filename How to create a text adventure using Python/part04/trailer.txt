You wake up in a dark alley.
Blood flows freely from a wound on your head and your clothes are
dirty and torn. You have no idea where you are or even who you are.
A helpful lamplighter -- Old Ben -- tells you that you're just outside
the shipyards and directs you to the nearest town and a local pub
known as The Mad Hatter. He assures you that, if you mention he sent you,
that Lilly, the pubâ€™s avaricious owner, will patch you up,
provide you with hot food, a warm bed and information about a crest
that is embroidered into the silken fabric of your dress,
information that could help you discover who you are and
what brought you to this particular town.
